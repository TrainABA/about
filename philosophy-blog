# Update
TrainABA is maintained by B.T., whose PhD coursework ended summer 2017. At the time of writing, B.T. was out of classes for two months and had resumed TrainABA development. After focusing on the coursework, the question is what will TrainABA look like now that B.T. is back?

The next order of business for TrainABA is to start organizing content that others can readily download, modify, and customize to their particular needs for work, school, and making continuing education. If you think about the content of TrainABA, it spans a university bachelor's and master's degree of contents toward credentialing. It also includes structure for behavior analysis training across 1500 hours of structured internship, plus ongoing supervision of all billable levels ever after. That's a lot of material already, and that's just in English. The foreign language offerings have not hit shelves yet.

To manage and deploy a system like TrainABA, it's going to take some serious dev-ops and implementation of open source technologies. We're talking Github repos galore, IRC, various CMS options, LMS platform cartridges, PDFs, ebooks, and plain text docs from tiny definition lists all the way to a whole graduate degree's worth of info.  All of that is fair game between now and proliferation of machine learning algorithms and personalized databases spanning IoT devices, continuing education, job performance, etc. Together, the ABA profession has a chance at leveraging these emerging technologies. If the industry continues on a fragmented path as it has traditionally, the only force behind APIs and connected IoT devices will be proprietary software companies. 

Historically, that has been problematic for advancement of rapidly developing technologies because the legalities necessitate stable, protected formats involving digital rights management. Such mechanisms support business security for the copyright holders but make it difficult (or impossible) for average users to maintain the four basic freedoms that characterize free and open source tenchologies. The user retains freedom to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software as desired, so long as the same freedoms are passed on to the next users. For something like TrainABA, that would involve founders retaining credit for their work without being responsible for modifications users make. For example, someone may decide to build a program for teaching a debunked methodology in conjunction with TrainABA materials at a company seminar. That's a clear case of the user exercising rights to use, copy, modify, and distribute the materials as desired without holding the original author(s) of the materials responsible. The name of the license I just described is GNU Free Documentation License v1.3. Someone, included those who modify the contents that were downloaded from the TrainABA site for no cost, could resell the original or modified version of TrainABA materials under this license. It would make no difference in terms of legal or ethical issues whether the items were sold for a price or delivered gratis. Freedoms in "free" software have nothing to do with price.

By contrast, this article reflects the author's opinions and should not be redistributed with modifications from others. These are the words and views of B.T. The license appropriate for this type of work is Creative Commons, attribution - no derivatives - commercial use. That means a person creating a training program for paying customers (including a state agency or insurance provider paying the bill) could incorporate this information into their materials as-is (no modifications), without legal recourse. The person would make sure not to falsely claim authorship, or make modifications (regardless of who was credited for the modified writing). The name of the license I just described is Creative Commons 4.0 - Attribution - No Derivatives - Commercial Use. It is okay to sell these materials even if you obtained them for free, so long as you attribute authorship appropriately, do not modify or make derivative works, and pass on the same freedoms with the work you distribute.

Last but not least, the third license TrainABA promotes is the GNU General Public License V2.0. Sadly, TrainABA does not get to use this license much for our own work because B.T. is still working at the level of systems administration and not writing much original software at this point. The idea with this license is similar to that of the GNU Free Documentation License v1.3 described earlier. It provides four freedoms to use, copy, modify, and distribute the software as desired so long as the same freedoms and passed onward to future recipients.

Admittedly, all this talk about licenses will put some readers to sleep. These are important topics of discussion in these early years of structuring TrainABA for the future. These decisions are very different than the stance that has been adopted by the credentialing organizations, which are slow and formal to pass freedoms to card-carrying credential holders. TrainABA's choice to secure the four freedoms and utilize the licenses herein described is offered as an alternative. At some point, it is possible that the credentialing board may change its policies with credential holders and revoke freedoms it has currently extended on a short-term, contractual basis with universities and organizations. TrainABA aims to promote community that is decentralized, therefore these freedoms are even more important because many organizations can readily use and rely on these materials in the long run, investing time and resources in building programs around these materials and then mapping them to whatever the credentialing board publishes in the future. In 10, 20, or 40 years, this grows in importance.  

Next, it is expected that B.T. will be subject to moral and ethical scrutiny by those who view TrainABA as a non-physical technology. This principle was identified by B.F. Skinner in his observation of how societies looked to behavioral scientists differently than scientists of physical technologies, say, or an engineer who builds bridges. Due to this principle, B.T. will continue building the TrainABA infrastructure and software until it is clear that TrainABA is a physical technology used as a framework by a good number of practitioners worldwide in various languages. Once that is established, B.T. will be able to work about more publicly.

In returning to TrainABA, B.T. has reviewed the TrainABA archives and found an inspiring number of materials. Many TrainABA artifacts have resurfaced from vaulted hard drives and files. Found items included hundreds of PDFs, slideshows, quiz modules, and all kinds of things that most TrainABA book users do not even know about. Something must change for the contents to get out to people who need them. Almost no effort has been expended into marketing TrainABA.

The best model for organizing TrainABA contents appears to be making it for as many platforms as possible, especially based on what people use, and making a downloadable version available in certain ways. More choices are better. As B.T. continues to develop the TrainABA platforms, more structure will follow. Since it's inception in 2013, revenue from TrainABA gets fed back into TrainABA to develop TrainABA. That pattern will continue. As a DBA and then C-Corporation, the next steps involve pursuit of non-profit status to further communicate the purpose and nature of TrainABA. Perhaps not much will happen in 2017 but it appears TrainABA will advance in 2018.
